          <h1 id="science">Caffeine: From Safe Use to Overdose</h1>
          <p>For most healthy adults, up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is a safe limit. That’s roughly the amount of caffeine in: </p> 
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>4</strong> cups of brewed coffee</li>
            <li><strong>10</strong> cans of cola</li>
            <li> <strong>2</strong> "energy shot" drinks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Individual tolerance varies widely depending on factors including genetics, body weight, and overall health. </p>
          <p>According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, consumers should be aware that highly concentrated forms of caffeine, such as <strong>powders or liquid products</strong>, can reach toxic levels very quickly. For example, a single teaspoon of powdered caffeine may contain the equivalent of about 28 cups of coffee. Consuming amounts this high can lead to serious health problems and, in extreme cases, can be life-threatening.</p>
          <p>Although moderate caffeine use is generally considered safe for most adults, it is not risk-free for everyone. <strong>Children and teens</strong> are typically more sensitive to its effects, and young adults should be cautious about combining caffeine with alcohol or other substances. Individuals who are <strong>pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding</strong> are often advised to speak with a healthcare professional about limiting their intake.</p>

        <p class="timing-summary">
        After consumption, caffeine does not leave the body immediately. Its average half-life is about five hours, meaning it takes roughly that long for half of the caffeine you consumed to be metabolized. In practical terms, if you drink a caffeinated beverage in the afternoon, a significant amount may still be active in your system by the evening.
        </p>
        <p>The stimulating effects of caffeine typically peak within 30 to 60 minutes after consumption. This is when alertness and sometimes jitteriness is most noticeable. Because caffeine can stay in the body for several hours, individuals who are more sensitive to it may continue to feel its effects well into the evening.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Caffeine can affect sleep quality and duration, especially if consumed within 6 hours of bedtime.</p>

        <h1>The Caffeine Crash</h1>
        <p>A caffeine crash refers to the drop in energy and focus that can occur after caffeine’s stimulating effects wear off. While caffeine temporarily increases alertness, it does not eliminate fatigue. Consumer may still experience side effects such as headaches, excessive tiredness, difficulty concentrating, or irritability after the initial boost fades.</p>
        <p>Regular caffeine use can also lead to mild dependence. If intake is suddenly reduced or stopped, withdrawal symptoms like headaches and low energy may resemble or intensify a crash. For this reason, reducing caffeine gradually is generally recommended rather than abruptly quitting.</p>

        <h2>Ways to reduce crashes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistent, adequate sleep</li>
          <li>Avoid caffeine within 5–6 hours of bedtime</li>
          <li>Avoid highly concentrated caffeine products</li>
          <li>Reduce overall caffeine intake gradually</li>
